PenguinBindings
===============

I was looking for a keybind addon for WoW 5.4, but couldn't find one that I liked(updated), so I'm making one.

Plan:
	Binding buttons is unnecessary, and could cause crashes if button isn't loaded currently.
	Profiles
	More slash commands
	Binding tests

		
Complete:
	Bind Spells/Items/Macros(Only from macro frame)
	Save spells to character 
	Clear a binding
	
Todo:
	Setup profiles
	Clear all bindings
	Settings
	Binding Test
