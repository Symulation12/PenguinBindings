PenguinBindings
===============

I was looking for a keybind addon for WoW 5.4, but couldn't find one that I liked(updated), so I'm making one.

New plan:
	Bind mode:
		When you mouse over something and press a key combination, the addon will ask you if you want to bind those keys to that item/spell/macro/button?
		Could be annoying if done while moving, should only be done when out of combat (can't bind in combat anyway)
	BIND ALL THE THINGS!
	Be able to bind anything that can be from anywhere it can be, and if I can't, do it anyway.
	Commands:
		Clear all bindings
		Toggle bind mode [x]
		Switch profiles
		Change certain setting (profile limit,etc.)

		
Complete:
	Bind Spells(NOTE: only spells)
	Save spells to character 
	Clear a binding
	
Todo:
	Bind Items and Macros (and frames?)
	Setup profiles
	Clear all bindings
	Settings
